# Generate a TE consensus sequence file (--TE argument)

This file is part of the TEspeX manual, some of the TEspeX prerequisites (https://github.com/fansalon/TEspeX#prerequisites) may be prerequisites also for the installation commmands listed here.

Theoretically, TEspeX is supposed to work on any type of TE consensus sequence. However, providing a good input file may increase the accuracy of TEspeX.

TEspeX has been largely tested on Dfam and RepBase consensus sequences. Being aware that while the former is freely available the latter is not instructions to use both databases are reported below.

## **Dfam** ##

To use the Dfam database as source of TE consensus sequences follow the instrucionts listed below.

Download the Dfam curated database:
```wget https://www.dfam.org/releases/Dfam_3.3/families/Dfam.h5.gz```

If working on Mac Os:
```curl -L -o Dfma.h5.gz https://www.dfam.org/releases/Dfam_3.3/families/Dfam.h5.gz```
